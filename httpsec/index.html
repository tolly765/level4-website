	<h1>HTTP & Security</h1>
	<p>Here are the questions:</p>
	<ol start="1">
		<li>What is the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP)</li>
		<li>Why is HTTP called a stateless protocol?</li>
		<li>Describe the three phases of establishing a session using client-server protocols such as HTTP</li>
		<li>Describe the parameters on a get and post request.</li>
		<li>What are the HTTP response status code and What do the HTTP status codes, 200, and 404 indicate?</li>
		<li>What are HTTP cookies? Give an example.</li>
		<li>Why are cookies a security issue?</li>
		<li>Describe session hijacking and XSS</li>
		<li>Describe Cross-site request forgery(CSRF)</li>
		<li>What are Cross-site HTTP requests (CORS) and what requests use CORS?</li>
	</ol>

	<p>Here are the answers to the questions in order: </p>
	<ol start="1">
		<li>The hypertext transfer protocol is an application-layer protocol for transmitting documents like HTML, CSS and more. It was designed for communication between web browsers and web servers, but it can also be used for other purposes.</li>
		<li>The server does not keep any data between two different requests.</li>
		<li>
			<ul>
				<li>The client establishes a TCP connection (or the appropriate connection if the transport layer is not TCP).</li>
				<li>The client sends its request, and waits for the answer.</li>
				<li>The server processes the request, sending back its answer, providing a status code and appropriate data.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Every request is written within the url that works when the url us submitted. The parameters are writen in the header of the request, with the body of the content taking the following format in the url: page?parameter=value&also=another</li>
		<li>A HTTP response status code is a type of message that is sent by the web server to the client that tells the browser what happened to their request. <br><br>A response 200 means a response of OK, and usually indicates that the request was successful. A response 404 indicates a file not found error and it means that the server could not find a requested file on the server.</li>
		<li>HTTP cookies are small pieces of information that are stored on a computer in order to provide some persistent information on the device. An example would be a cookie that stores the current </li>
		<li>Cookies can be a security risk as they are usually stored in plain-text and can be read in a very simple way. This can be abused in order to gain access to a user's online session or other sensitive information.</li>
		<li>Session hijacking is the process of taking over a valid session between two different computers. THis is done by stealing a valid session ID in order to access a system in an unauthorised manner. <br><br> XSS refers to Cross-site-scripting and can be used in order to gain access to a user's system or sensitive information. THis is done by forcing the user to load an untrusted or unauthorised script (either through loading a page from an untrusted source, or when dynamic content like adverts are sent to a web user without their consent) and they can perform almost any action on the computer if they are initiated.</li>
		<li>CSRF refers to a type of attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web page or application in which they have already authenticated themselves. These types of attacks will commonly target state-changing requests since CSRF attacks cannot explicitly access any stored information.</li>
		<li>CORS is a type of spec that allows cross-domain communication from the browser (from one server to another, even if they are not shared on the same domain). These are most commonly used in order to share login or personal info with multiple websites at once (if they support this - An example of this would be from partnered websites that offer different services but are owned by the same company like Twitch and Amazon).</li>
